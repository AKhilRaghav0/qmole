TODO list and known issues

Known issues
------------


- to allow composed characters (like ä, Ö, ê, etc.) to be entered in xfe, xfw, etc., the FOX library *must* be
  compiled with the --with-xim configure option.
- when opening a terminal using the Ctrl-T shortcut, after the second time, the right click menu doesn't work
  as expected (it works as if the ctrl key was always pressed). This problem can be seen with xterm, aterm or xvt, but
  there is no problem (at least on my Debian box) with rxvt or gnome-terminal. Sounds like a bad interaction between
  terminal programs and FOX/Xfe. As a workaround, pressing escape allows to return to the normal behaviour.
- if the mouse pointer is on a menu title, then it is not possible to navigate using the keyboard on the menu titles.
  This is a FOX issue.
- in Xfw, if the wordwrap mode is selected an line numbers are displayed, then the line numbers are uncorrectly
  displayed for wrapped lines. This is also a FOX issue.



To do
------

- add context options (copy / paste / delete) to the location bar, like in Firefox
- add the ability to copy a file in the same directory by adding the suffix '_copy' to the file name, just like Nautilus
  does
- add an option in the Preferences dialog to start Xfe in a given directory, in the last directory or in the home
  directory
- add a way to clean history lists (like the open file list, for example)
- internationalization of man files
- internationalization should handle multiple plural forms (required by languages like polish, czech, etc.)
- at the command line, Xfe should handle file names (and URIs) and open the associated application to open the file names
  (ex: xfe test.txt should edit the test.txt file, xfe /usr/bin/gimp should launch gimp, etc.)
- places (home + trash + mtab entries) and bookmark items could be displayed as a tab pane in the tree panel
- in detailed view, the user should have the ability to select the displayed columns
- add an option to set the default archive format
- file searching dialog (work already started but not completed yet) 
- use of MIME types in complement to file associations
- implement lenghty operations in background (directory size, thumbnails, copy...)
- indicator of global progress of file operations when multiple items have been selected
- simple archive program or implement VFS?
- df command (disk usage, on Linux only?)


User requests
--------------

- autosize file name header in detailed view
- context menus on text dialogs
- hotkeys to go directly to a directory
- implement users scripts (like in Nautilus)
- Samba support (network neighborhood, using Fuse?)
