NAME
----

awesome-menu - awesome menu system

SYNOPSIS
--------

awesome-menu [-c config] [-e command] <title>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

awesome-menu is a tool which will pop up a menu on your screen, grabbing
keyboard and allowing you to search through an initial completion list, or
using your files as completion.

USAGE
-----
By default, awesome-menu reads completion from standard input. If nothing is
read, the completion list is built from the current working directory files.

To build a menu with all the executable files of /usr/bin:

    ls /usr/bin | awesome-menu -e 'exec ' 'Execute'

To build the same menu and run the programs in a terminal window:

    ls /usr/bin | awesome-menu -e 'xterm -e exec ' 'Execute in terminal'

To build an ssh connection prompt:

    cut -d' ' -f1 ~/.ssh/known_hosts | cut -d, -f1 | awesome-menu -e 'xterm -e ssh ' 'ssh to:'

If you do not specify the -e option, the result will be sent to standard output.
You can do things like that:

    gzip "$(awesome-menu '"File to gzip')"

OPTIONS
-------
-c config::
    Use an alternate configuration file instead of $HOME/.awesomerc. 
-e command::
    Command to execute. The result is appended to the end of this command (like xargs).
<title>::
    Print this title. This is also used to identify the menu section in the awesomerc file.
