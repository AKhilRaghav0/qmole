NAME

awesome - awesome window manager

SYNOPSIS
--------

awesome [ -v | --version ] [ -h | --help ] [ -k | --check ] [ -s | --sync ] [ --config | -c configuration file ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

+awesome+ is a window manager for X. It manages windows in different layouts, like
floating or tiled. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.

In tiled layout windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area contains the windows which currently need most attention, whereas the
stacking area contains all other windows. In floating layout windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the layout applied. The spiral and dwindle layout are special cases
of the tiled layout where the stacking area is arranged in a spiral for the
former or as a rectangular fractal for the later.

Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.

awesome contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the layout,
the title of the focused window, and a status text. A
floating window is indicated with an empty circle and a maximized
floating window is indicated with a circle square before the windows
title. The selected tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of
the focused window are indicated with a filled square in the top left
corner. The tags which are applied to one or more windows are indicated
with an empty square in the top left corner.
awesome can draw a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

--config | -c::
    Use an alternate configuration file instead of $HOME/.awesomerc.
--check | -k::

BUGS
----
Of course there's no bug in awesome. But there may be unexpected behaviours.

Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. As a workaround
you can use JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or you
can set the following environment variable (to use the older Motif
backend instead): AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
