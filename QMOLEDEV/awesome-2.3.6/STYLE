If you intend to patch and contribute awesome, please respect the following coding style:
- Use 4 space indentation, do not use tabulator characters
- Place braces alone on new lines;
- Do not put a space after if, for, while or function call statements;
- The preferred line length is 80 characters;
- Be clear in what you do;
- Write documentation for any new functions, options, whatever.

A vim modeline is set in each file to respect this.
