Gxmessage is a GTK based xmessage clone


A note about version numbers
============================

In gxmessage-x.y.z, the 'x.y' part represents the GTK2 version that this
gxmessage package was developed with. The 'z' part represents gxmessage
releases since the last 'x.y' change.


Installation
============

For details, see the file named INSTALL.

If you're replacing a version of gxmessage older than 2.12.0, it would be a
good idea to uninstall that before installing this version. Otherwise you'll
end up with a redundant gxmessage icon sitting in /usr/local/share/pixmaps.

Under GNU/Linux, compilation and installation go something like this:

  $ cd gxmessage-x.y.z
  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  $ make
  $ sudo make install-strip
  $ make clean

To uninstall gxmessage:

  $ cd gxmessage-x.y.z
  $ sudo make uninstall


Getting help
============

If gxmessage is installed, the following commands will provide information:

  $ gxmessage -help    - A quick reminder of available options.
  $ man gxmessage      - A short manual page with each option explained.
  $ info gxmessage     - A detailed user guide with examples.

For some interesting scripts making use of gxmessage, take a look in the
'gxmessage-x.y.z/examples' directory.

Want to help?
=============

I'm always open to ideas and suggestions - and I'd love to know how you use
gxmessage. Let me know! But please keep in mind that gxmessage tries hard to
be compatible with xmessage: that's the whole point. So I'm unlikely to agree
to anything that interferes with that goal.

What gxmessage needs most right now is language translation. If you're
interested but not sure how, please send me an email. :^)
