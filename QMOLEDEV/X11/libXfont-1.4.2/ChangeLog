	* Bump version to 1.4.2.

2004-03-10  Daniel Stone  <daniel@freedesktop.org>
	* Makefile.am:
	Add fontmod.h to list of installed headers, as Xizzle uses it.

2004-03-09  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	Install 'fontutil.h' as the X font server uses it

2004-02-11  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* bitmap/bitmapfunc.c:
	* fontfile/Makefile.am:
	* fontfile/decompress.c: (BufFilePushCompressed):
	* fontfile/fileio.c: (FontFileOpen):
	Delete decompress (.Z) code as it had a BSD license with
	the advertising clause.

	* fontfile/dirfile.c:
	Fix a buffer overflow problem.

2004-02-06  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	* xfont.pc.in:
	Link library against zlib and libm, mark those as required in .pc
	as well.
	
	* FreeType/ft.h:
	* FreeType/ftenc.c:
	* FreeType/ftfuncs.c: (FTFindSize):
	* FreeType/fttools.c:
	Switch FreeType header include names to "approved" form.
	Use x_ppem/y_ppem from available_sizes array as that's what
	FreeType uses for matching bitmap fonts (in the TTF driver,
	and I've proposed the same for the PCF and BDF drivers)
	
	* fontfile/fontfile.c: (FontFileOpenBitmapNCF),
	(FontFileGetInfoBitmap):
	Fall back to scalable functions for FreeType backend.  This
	makes bitmap-only fonts loadable through FreeType.  Soon the
	other font file loaders will no longer be necessary (muwahaha)

2004-02-03  Jim Gettys  <jg@freedesktop.org>

	* AUTHORS: Get a cut at an authors list.

	Use the new AC_INIT/AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE so that .tar.bz2 dists get made.
