      Exif Window
    </title>
    <para>
      The Exif window shows Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata that are present in the file. Unlike the other parts of the program, this window shows the "raw" metadata read from the file, without any postprocessing. Other parts of the program combines metadata from various formats and also merges in the sidecars and private metadata files. Thus, this window is ideal for metadata debugging. For normal use look at the Exif panes in the <link linkend="GuideSidebarsInfo">Info Sidebar</link>.
