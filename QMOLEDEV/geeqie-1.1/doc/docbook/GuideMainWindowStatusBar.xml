      Zoom

    <para>
      This section displays the current zoom ratio. A ratio of 1:1 is the image's original size. When the left number is larger the image is displayed larger than original size, when the right number is larger the image is displayed smaller.
    </para>
    <para>
      A tilde (~) appears within the ratio display when the zoom is set to fit the image within the display area. In this zoom mode the ratio is automatically adjusted, and the displayed ratio may not be the actual ratio because the status bar display rounds the actual value to the nearest tenth (0.1).
