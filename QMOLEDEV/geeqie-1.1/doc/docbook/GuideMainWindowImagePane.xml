    </title>
    <para>
      The image is drawn to the screen as it is decoded from disk. The image can be panned and zoomed while it is still loading. Image adjustment operations for rotation, mirror, and flip will delay until the image is completed. The adjustment queue will remember one operation and will retain the most recently requested function, which will be performed once the image has finished loading.
    </para>
    <para>
      The quality of the image, especially when using the zoom feature, is dependent on the settings that are available on the <link linkend="GuideOptionsImage">Image tab</link> of the preferences dialog.
