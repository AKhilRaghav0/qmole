Hints and FAQ
-------------

Hint: Don't restart::
   To make changes in yout autostart take effect immediately, just type
   +herbstclient reload+. There is no need to restart herbstluftwm or X.

Hint: Use the forc\^H\^H\^H^Hscripts!::
   There are a bunch of scripts coming along with herbstluftwm. Check out the
   scripts directory in the sources and the examples directory after installing.

Hint: Understanding processes::
    To understand the relationship between the different processes that running
    in a typical herbstluftwm setup, consider the following diagramm:
+
----
                startx
                  | f/e
                  V
             ~/.xinitrc
                  | f/e or exec
 IPC-Call         V
   .- - - -> herbstluftwm           __________________

   -- herbstclient     $SHELL
----

As you can see, +herbstclient+ does nothing except sending requests to
+herbstluftwm+. Whenever a process performs a fork-and-exec, the following
rules apply:

        * A child process inherits the environment variables of its parent
          process. If you change an environment variable (like 'PATH'), then it
          will stay unchanged in the parent process. +
          +
          => If you want to set some environment variables for your complete
          session (i.e. all processes) then you have to set it in your
          +~/.xinitrc+.

        * If a process spawns a window, then the window will spawn delayed. This
          delay differs from application to application (and from time to time).
          So a script like
+
----
herbstclient spawn xterm
herbstclient spawn xev
----
+
does *not* guarantee that the +xterm+ window will appear before the
+xev+ window! It only guarantees that the +xterm+ is executed before +xev+ will
be executed.+
+
=> If you want to apply some rules only for the next windows, then use a
bash-script like the one for <<TEMP_RULES,temporary rules>>.


Q: Why is herbstluftwm called herbstluftwm?::
   I liked the name of the e-mail client wanderlust. Unfortunately I am a happy
   mutt user, so I needed an other application with a similar name.

Q: If the config is a bashscript, does it mean it is called on each keystroke?::
   No, the configuration file is executed once to set internal settings and
   keybindings and so on. If a keybinding is registered and its key is pressed,
   the according (internal) command directly is called.

Q: How can I let single clients float?::
    Not at all. You don't need it. You have the power of manual tiling, so
    there is no need to place clients manually by dragging. Even better:
    You don't even need to place them manually. Use a rule to place special
    dialogs automatically when they appear. See the GIMP-Example for a good
    example.

Q: But I use GIMP very often, how can I use it without floating?::
    Load a predefined layout to a gimp tag. Move the GIMP-Tool windows to the
    left and right border and put the rest in the center. Add this to your
    autostart:
+
----
# GIMP
# ensure there is a gimp tag
hc add gimp
hc load gimp '
(split horizontal:0.850000:0
  (split horizontal:0.200000:1
    (clients vertical:0)
    (clients grid:0))
  (clients vertical:0))
'               # load predefined layout
# center all other gimp windows on gimp tag
hc rule class=Gimp tag=gimp index=01 pseudotile=on
hc rule class=Gimp windowrole~'gimp-(image-window|toolbox|dock)' \
    pseudotile=off
hc rule class=Gimp windowrole=gimp-toolbox focus=off index=00
hc rule class=Gimp windowrole=gimp-dock focus=off index=1
----
+

[[TEMP_RULES]]
Q: How can I add rules temporarily for some special clients?::
    Add a rule for the clients pid, before the client appears. This script
    creates two xterms with different behaviours:
+
----
#!/bin/bash

# Requirement: bash >= 4.0 (because of the usage of $BASHPID)

spawn_with_rules() {(
    # this rule also requires, that the client
    # sets the _NET_WM_PID property
    herbstclient rule once pid=$BASHPID maxage=10 "${RULES[@]}"
    exec "$@"
    ) &
}

# spawn an xterm with uname info, but not where the focus is
RULES=( index='/' focus=off )
spawn_with_rules xterm -e 'uname -a ; read'

# spawn an xterm in pseudotile mode
RULES=( pseudotile=on focus=on )
spawn_with_rules xterm
----

Q: Why doesn't a new client receive focus?::
   The reason is the default setting of the +focus+ consequence in the rules.
   You can change it by adding this to the link:herbstluftwm.html#RULES[rules]
   section in the autostart file:
+
----
hc unrule --all      # clear rules
hc rule focus=on     # focus new clients by default
----
+
Warning: you need the current git version to get rules!

Q: herbstclient is too long to type it in the shell::
    Use tab-completion! +her&lt;tab&gt;c&lt;tab&gt;+ expands to herbstclient.
    There is also a tab-completion for the herbstclient parameters. After
    installing herbstluftwm, add this to your .bashrc:
+
----
source /etc/bash_completion.d/herbstclient-completion
----
+
(The tab-completion in zsh works out of the box with most zsh-configurations).
+
You also can add an alias for herbstclient:
+
----
alias hc='herbstclient'
----

Q: My rules seem to be messed up::
    Clear them with +hc unrule -F+ and start over. It is recommended to do this
    in the autostart file.

Q: I don't like that my mplayervideo/inputdialogs get resized to full framesize::

Add this to your autostartfile:
+
----
hc rule instance=<instance> pseudotile=on
----
+
You can request the instancename with xprop by clicking on the related window.
+<instancename>+ is the first string in the line +WM_CLASS(STRING)+ (for
mplayer that would be +xv+, for firefox dialogs it is +Dialog+).

Q: I set default_frame_layout to my favorite layout but it doesn't work with the root frame/existing frames::
    Existing tags are not affected by a change of that variable (only new
    ones), so be sure to set it *before* creating any tags. A current
    workaround is to put +hc split vertical 0.5; hc remove+ at the end in your
    autostartfile.  You can also 'cycle_layout' in existing tags.
