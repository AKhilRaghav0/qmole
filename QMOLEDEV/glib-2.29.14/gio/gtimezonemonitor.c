/**
 * SECTION:gtimezonemonitor
 * @title: GTimeZoneMonitor
 * @short_description: Monitor the local timezone
 *
 * #GTimeZoneMonitor is a utility class to monitor the local timezone for
 * changes (ie: in response to the user manually changing the timezone
 * to that of a different locale).
 *
 * You must use this class in order for your program to notice changes
 * to the local timezone.  It works by monitoring the /etc/localtime
 * file.  When the timezone is found to have changed,
 * g_time_zone_refresh_local() is called and the "changed" signal is
 * emitted on the #GTimeZoneMonitor (in that order).
 *
 * Windows support is not presently working.
