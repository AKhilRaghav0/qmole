Colors format in *awesome* are either standard X color names
(blue, darkblue, lightred, etc) or hexadecimal formatted colors (#rrggbb
or #rrggbbaa).
By using hexadecimal format, you can also specifies an alpha channel:
that means that #00ff00 will draw pure green, but #00ff00aa will set the
alpha channel to `aa' and will blend the green with the color under it.

You can use Pango markup in text string.
This allows to format the text rendered in widgets.
