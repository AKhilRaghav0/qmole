PolyglotMan, rman - reverse compile man pages from formatted form to
a number of source formats

<I>PolyglotMan
</I> takes man pages from most of the popular flavors of UNIX and transforms
them into any of a number of text source formats. PolyglotMan was formerly
known as RosettaMan. The name of the binary is still called <I>rman </I>, for scripts
that depend on that name; mnemonically, just think "reverse man". Previously
<I> PolyglotMan </I> required pages to be formatted by nroff prior to its processing.
With version 3.0, it <I>prefers [tn]roff source </I> and usually produces results
that are better yet. And source processing is the only way to translate
tables. Source format translation is not as mature as formatted, however,
so try formatted translation as a backup. <P>
In parsing [tn]roff source, one
could implement an arbitrarily large subset of [tn]roff, which I did not
and will not do, so the results can be off. I did implement a significant
subset of those use in man pages, however, including tbl (but not eqn),
if tests, and general macro definitions, so usually the results look great.
If they don't, format the page with nroff before  sending it to PolyglotMan.
If PolyglotMan doesn't recognize a  key macro used by a large class of pages,
however, e-mail me the source and a uuencoded nroff-formatted page and I'll
see  what I can do. When running PolyglotMan with man page source that includes
or redirects to other [tn]roff source using the .so (source or inclusion)
macro, you should be in the parent directory of the page, since pages are
written with this assumption. For example, if you are translating /usr/man/man1/ls.1,
first cd into /usr/man. <P>
<I>PolyglotMan </I> accepts man pages from: SunOS, Sun
Solaris, Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&amp;T System V, OSF/1 aka Digital UNIX, DEC
Ultrix, SGI IRIX, Linux, FreeBSD, SCO. Source processing works for: SunOS,
Sun Solaris, Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&amp;T System V, OSF/1 aka Digital UNIX,
DEC Ultrix. It can produce printable ASCII-only (control characters stripped),
section headers-only, Tk, TkMan, [tn]roff (traditional man page source),
SGML, HTML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, RTF, Perl 5 POD. A modular architecture
permits easy addition of additional output formats. <P>
The latest version of
PolyglotMan is always available from <I> ftp: 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"></I>Options</A></H2>
The following options
should not be used with any others and exit PolyglotMan without processing
any input. 
<DL>

<DT>-h|--help </DT>
<DD>Show list of command line options and exit. </DD>

<DT>-v|--version </DT>
<DD>Show
version number and exit. </DD>
</DL>
<P>
<I>You should specify the filter first, as this sets
a number of parameters, and then specify other options. 
<DL>

<DT>-f|--filter &lt;ASCII|roff|TkMan|Tk|Sections|HTML|SGML|MIME|LaTeX|LaTeX2e|RTF|POD&gt;
</I></DT>
<DD>Set the output filter. Defaults to ASCII. </DD>

<DT>-S|--source </DT>
<DD>PolyglotMan tries to automatically
determine whether its input is source or formatted; use this option to
declare source input. </DD>

<DT>-F|--format|--formatted </DT>
<DD>PolyglotMan tries to automatically
determine whether its input is source or formatted; use this option to
declare formatted input. </DD>

<DT>-l|--title <I>printf-string </I> </DT>
<DD>In HTML mode this sets the
&lt;TITLE&gt; of the man pages, given the same parameters as <I>-r </I>. </DD>

<DT>-r|--reference|--manref
<I>printf-string </I> </DT>
<DD>In HTML and SGML modes this sets the URL form by which to
retrieve other man pages. The string can use two supplied parameters: the
man page name and its section. (See the Examples section.) If the string
is null (as if set from a shell by "-r ''"), `-'  or `off', then man page references
will not be HREFs, just set  in italics. If your printf supports XPG3 positions
specifier, this can be quite flexible. </DD>

<DT>-V|--volumes <I>&lt;colon-separated list&gt; </I> </DT>
<DD>Set
the list of valid volumes to check against when looking for cross-references
to other man pages. Defaults to <I>1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:o:l:n:p </I>(volume names
can be multicharacter). If an non-whitespace string in the page is immediately
followed by a left parenthesis, then one of the valid volumes, and ends
with optional other characters and then a right parenthesis--then that string
is reported as a reference to another manual page. If this -V string starts
with an equals sign, then no optional characters are allowed between the
match to the list of valids and the right parenthesis. (This option is needed
for SCO UNIX.) </DD>
</DL>
<P>
The following options apply only when formatted pages are
given as input. They do not apply or are always handled correctly with the
source. 
<DL>

<DT>-b|--subsections </DT>
<DD>Try to recognize subsection titles in addition to section
titles. This can cause problems on some UNIX flavors. </DD>

<DT>-K|--nobreak </DT>
<DD>Indicate manual
pages don't have page breaks, so don't look for footers and headers around
them. (Older nroff -man macros always put in page breaks, but lately some
vendors have realized that printout are made through troff, whereas nroff
-man is used to format pages for reading on screen, and so have eliminated
page breaks.) <I>PolyglotMan </I> usually gets this right even without this flag.
</DD>

<DT>-k|--keep </DT>
<DD>Keep headers and footers, as a canonical report at the end of the
page. changeleft Move changebars, such as those found in the Tcl/Tk manual
pages, to the left. --&gt; notaggressive <I>Disable </I> aggressive man page parsing.
Aggressive manual, which is on by default, page parsing elides headers
and footers, identifies sections and more. --&gt; </DD>

<DT>-n|--name <I>name </I> </DT>
<DD>Set name of man
page (used in roff format). If the filename is given in the form " <I>name
</I>. <I>section </I>", the name and section are automatically determined. If the page
is being parsed from [tn]roff source and it has a .TH line, this information
is extracted from that line. </DD>

<DT>-p|--paragraph </DT>
<DD>paragraph mode toggle. The filter
determines whether lines should be linebroken as they were by nroff, or
whether lines should be flowed together into paragraphs. Mainly for internal
use. </DD>

<DT>-s|section <I># </I> </DT>
<DD>Set volume (aka section) number of man page (used in roff
format). tables Turn on aggressive table parsing. --&gt; </DD>

<DT>-t|--tabstops <I># </I> </DT>
<DD>For those
macros sets that use tabs in place of spaces where possible in order to
reduce the number of characters used, set tabstops every <I># </I> columns. Defaults
to 8. </DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4">Notes on Filter Types</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5">Roff</A></H3>
Some flavors of UNIX ship man page without
[tn]roff source, making one's laser printer little more than a laser-powered
daisy wheel.  This filer tries to intuit the original [tn]roff directives,
which can then be recompiled by [tn]roff. 
<H3><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6">TkMan</A></H3>
TkMan, a hypertext man page
browser, uses <I>PolyglotMan </I> to show man pages without the (usually) useless
headers and footers on each pages. It also collects section and (optionally)
subsection heads for direct access from a pulldown menu. TkMan and Tcl/Tk,
the toolkit in which it's written, are available via anonymous  ftp from
<I>ftp: 
<H3><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"></I>Tk</A></H3>
This option outputs the text in a series of Tcl lists consisting
of text-tags pairs, where tag names roughly correspond to HTML. This output
can be inserted into a Tk text widget by doing an <I> eval &lt;textwidget&gt; insert
end &lt;text&gt; </I>. This format should be relatively easily parsible by other programs
that want both the text and the tags. Also see ASCII. 
<H3><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8">Ascii</A></H3>
When printed on
a line printer, man pages try to produce special text effects by overstriking
characters with themselves (to produce bold) and underscores (underlining).
Other text processing software, such as text editors, searchers, and indexers,
must counteract this. The ASCII filter strips away this formatting. Piping
nroff output through <I>col -b </I> also strips away this formatting, but it leaves
behind unsightly page headers and footers. Also see Tk. 
<H3><A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9">Sections</A></H3>
Dumps section
and (optionally) subsection titles. This might be useful for another program
that processes man pages. 
<H3><A NAME="sect10" HREF="#toc10">HTML</A></H3>
With a simple extention to an HTTP server
for Mosaic or other World Wide Web browser, <I>PolyglotMan </I> can produce high
quality HTML on the fly. Several such extensions and pointers to several
others are included in <I>PolyglotMan </I>'s <I>contrib </I> directory.  
<H3><A NAME="sect11" HREF="#toc11">Sgml</A></H3>
This is appoaching
the Docbook DTD, but I'm hoping that someone  that someone with a real interest
in this will polish the tags generated. Try it to see how close the tags
are now. 
<H3><A NAME="sect12" HREF="#toc12">MIME</A></H3>
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) as defined by
RFC 1563, good for consumption by MIME-aware e-mailers or as Emacs (&gt;=19.29)
enriched documents. 
<H3><A NAME="sect13" HREF="#toc13">LaTeX and LaTeX2e</A></H3>
Why not? 
<H3><A NAME="sect14" HREF="#toc14">Rtf</A></H3>
Use output on Mac or NeXT
or whatever. Maybe take random man pages and integrate with NeXT's documentation
system better.  Maybe NeXT has own man page macros that do this. 
<H3><A NAME="sect15" HREF="#toc15">PostScript
and FrameMaker</A></H3>
To produce PostScript, use <I>groff </I> or <I>psroff </I>. To produce FrameMaker
MIF, use FrameMaker's builtin filter. In both  cases you need <I>[tn]roff </I> source,
so if you only have a formatted version of the manual page, use <I>PolyglotMan
</I>'s  roff filter first. 
<H2><A NAME="sect16" HREF="#toc16">Examples</A></H2>
To convert the <I>formatted </I> man page named <I>ls.1
</I> back into [tn]roff source form: <P>
<I>rman -f roff /usr/local/man/cat1/ls.1 &gt; /usr/local/man/man1/ls.1
</I> <BR>
<P>
Long man pages are often compressed to conserve space (compression is especially
effective on formatted man pages as many of the characters are spaces).
As it is a long man page, it probably has subsections, which we try to
separate out (some macro sets don't distinguish subsections well enough
for <I>PolyglotMan </I> to detect them). Let's convert this to LaTeX format:  <BR>
<P>
<I>pcat /usr/catman/a_man/cat1/automount.z | rman -b -n automount -s 1 -f latex
&gt; automount.man </I> <BR>
<P>
Alternatively, <I>man 1 automount | rman -b -n automount -s 1 -f latex &gt; automount.man
</I> <BR>
<P>
For HTML/Mosaic users, <I>PolyglotMan </I> can, without modification of the source
code, produce HTML links that point to other HTML man pages either pregenerated
or generated on the fly. First let's assume pregenerated HTML versions of
man pages stored in <I>/usr/man/html </I>.  Generate these one-by-one with the following
form: <BR>
<I>rman -f html -r '<A HREF="http:/usr/man/html/%s.%s.html">http:/usr/man/html/%s.%s.html'</A>
 /usr/man/cat1/ls.1 &gt; /usr/man/html/ls.1.html
</I> <BR>
<P>
If you've extended your HTML client to generate HTML on the fly  you should
use something like: <BR>
<I>rman -f html -r '<A HREF="http:~/bin/man2html?%s:%s">http:~/bin/man2html?%s:%s'</A>
 /usr/man/cat1/ls.1 </I> <BR>
when generating HTML. 
<H2><A NAME="sect17" HREF="#toc17">Bugs/Incompatibilities</A></H2>
<I>PolyglotMan </I> is not perfect
in all cases, but it usually does a good job, and in any case reduces the
problem of converting man pages to light editing. <P>
Tables in formatted pages,
especially H-P's, aren't handled very well. Be sure to pass in source for the
page to recognize tables. <P>
The man pager <I>woman </I> applies its own idea of formatting
for man pages, which can confuse <I>PolyglotMan </I>. Bypass <I> woman </I> by passing
the formatted manual page text directly into <I>PolyglotMan </I>. <P>
The [tn]roff
output format uses fB to turn on boldface. If your macro set requires .B,
you'll have to a postprocess the <I>PolyglotMan </I> output.
