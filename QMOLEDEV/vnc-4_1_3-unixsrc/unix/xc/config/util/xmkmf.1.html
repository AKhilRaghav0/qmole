xmkmf - create a Makefile from an Imakefile

<B>xmkmf</B> [ -a ] [ <I>topdir</I> [ <I>curdir</I> ] ] 
<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">Description</A></H2>
The <I>xmkmf</I> command
is the normal way to create a <I>Makefile</I> from an <I>Imakefile</I> shipped with third-party
software. <P>
When invoked with no arguments in a directory containing an <I>Imakefile,</I>
the <I>imake</I> program is run with arguments appropriate for your system (configured
into <I>xmkmf</I> when X was built) and generates a <I>Makefile.</I> <P>
When invoked with
the <I>-a</I> option, <I>xmkmf</I> builds the <I>Makefile</I> in the current directory, and then
automatically executes ``make Makefiles'' (in case there are subdirectories),
``make includes'', and ``make depend'' for you. This is the normal way to configure
software that is outside the X Consortium build tree. <P>
If working inside
the X Consortium build tree (unlikely unless you are an X developer, and
even then this option is never really used), the <I>topdir</I> argument should
be specified as the relative pathname from the current directory to the
top of the build tree. Optionally, <I>curdir</I> may be specified as a relative
pathname from the top of the build tree to the current directory. It is
necessary to supply <I>curdir</I> if the current directory has subdirectories,
or the <I>Makefile</I> will not be able to build the subdirectories. If a <I>topdir</I>
is given, <I>xmkmf</I> assumes nothing is installed on your system and looks for
files in the build tree instead of using the installed versions.
